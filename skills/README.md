# AI Skills

Structured instructions for AI agents. Each skill encodes the methodology from very senior systems engineers — not just what commands to run, but how to interpret results, distinguish symptoms from root causes, and trace causal chains across the full stack. The agent reads the relevant skill on demand when the user's request matches its trigger keywords.

## How agents discover skills

Both [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, which references skill files by path.

For [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) job submission and direct-container runs, see [Kubernetes job submission](../docs/k8s-job-submission.md).
